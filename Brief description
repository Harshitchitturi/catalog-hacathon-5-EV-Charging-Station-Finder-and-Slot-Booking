EV Charging Station Finder and Slot Booking
  
1. Problem Definition
The application should allow users to:

Search for EV Charging Stations: Users can search for nearby charging stations using multiple filters such as location, charging speed, availability, etc.
Book Charging Slots: Users can book a charging slot in advance to avoid waiting in queues.

2. Features to Implement
Charging Station Search:
Filters: Location, charging speed (e.g., 50kW, 150kW), connector type (e.g., CCS, CHAdeMO), availability (real-time), distance, and price.
Search Results: Display a list of charging stations matching the filters.
Slot Booking:
Availability Check: Confirm the availability of charging slots at the selected station.
Booking: Book a slot for a specific date and time.
Confirmation: Provide confirmation details (e.g., station name, slot time, duration).

3. Technologies
Programming Language: Python or Java.
Data Handling:
Use a mock dataset or read data from files (e.g., JSON, CSV) for charging stations.
For bookings, data can be temporarily stored in memory (using dictionaries, lists) since no database storage is required.

4. Project Structure
Charging Station Data: Create a data structure or mock dataset containing information about various charging stations.
Filters: Implement filtering logic to search through the dataset based on user input.
Slot Availability: Simulate slot availability for different time slots.
Booking System: Implement a simple booking system that stores booking details in memory.

5. Implementation Steps
Set up the environment:

Choose your programming language (Python or Java).
Create a basic project structure.
Create the charging station dataset:

Develop a dataset with attributes like station ID, name, location, charging speed, connector type, etc.
Implement the search functionality:

Allow users to input filters.
Search the dataset based on these filters and display matching results.
Implement the booking functionality:

Check slot availability for the chosen station and time.
Book the slot and store the booking information in memory.
User Interaction:

Create a simple command-line interface for the user to interact with the application.
Guide the user through the process of searching for stations and booking slots.

6. Output Expectation
Console-based Output:
Search Results: List of available charging stations.
